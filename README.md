Car Sales Dashboard Project

overview :- Welcome to the Car Sales Dashboard project! This repository provides a comprehensive overview of how i built a dynamic and interactive dashboard using Power BI to track and analyze our car dealership's sales performance. my goal is to equip  team with a powerful tool to monitor sales metrics, pricing trends, and other critical data points, helping to make informed business decisions and drive growth.


Objective :- The primary objective of this project was to develop a Car Sales Dashboard in Power BI that enables us to:

-Visualize key sales metrics 
-Analyze pricing trends
-Monitor sales volume
-Identify growth opportunities


Key Features :- 

1. Sales Metrics :- The dashboard tracks essential sales metrics to monitor performance:

Year-to-Date (YTD) Sales: Displays the total sales amount from the beginning of the year to the present date.

Month-to-Date (MTD) Sales: Shows the total sales amount for the current month.

Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth: Compares this year’s total sales with the previous year to evaluate growth or decline.

Comparison with Previous Year-to-Date Sales: Assesses how current YTD sales compare with the same period last year.

2. Pricing Analysis :- Understanding pricing trends is key to our strategy:

YTD Average Price: Calculates the average selling price of cars from the start of the year to now.

MTD Average Price: Shows the average price of cars sold this month.

YOY Growth in Average Price: Compares the average price of cars this year with last year’s average price.

Price Comparison with Previous Year: Looks at how current average prices measure up against those from the same period last year.

3. Cars Sold Metrics :- To evaluate sales volume, we track:

YTD Cars Sold: Total number of cars sold year-to-date.

MTD Cars Sold: Number of cars sold this month.

YOY Growth in Cars Sold: Compares the number of cars sold this year with the previous year.

Comparison with Previous Year-to-Date Sales: Examines how current YTD car sales compare to the same period last year.

Visualizations :- The dashboard features various visualizations to make data interpretation easy:

Weekly Sales Trend: A line chart showing sales changes on a weekly basis throughout the year.

Sales by Body Style: A pie chart displaying sales distribution by car body style, highlighting the most popular types.

Sales by Color: A pie chart revealing which car colors are selling best.

Sales by Dealer Region: A map chart illustrating sales data across different regions, identifying areas with higher performance.

Company-Wise Sales Trends: A grid listing sales trends for each dealership, allowing for comparison between locations.

Detailed Sales Information: A comprehensive grid detailing each sale, including car model, body style, color, sales amount, and dealer region.


Conclusion :- The Car Sales Dashboard is designed to be a valuable resource for tracking and improving sales performance. By providing clear, real-time insights into sales metrics, pricing trends, and market distribution, this dashboard helps us make better decisions and drive our business forward.Thank you for your interest in my project!
